# FlexibleMomentExamples
An examples repo demonstrating the capabilities of the flexible method of moments in several idealized settings (box, parcel, kinematic driver), with references to SDM and traditional methods.
Most examples run in Julia. Superdroplet Method comparisons use the Python-based PySDM.
